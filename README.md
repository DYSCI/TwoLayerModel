Model of Reflectance from Media with Two Distinct Optical Layers
=============

Implementation of the following paper:

* Yudovsky, Dmitry, and Laurent Pilon. "Simple and accurate expressions for diffuse reflectance of semi-infinite and two-layer absorbing and scattering media." Applied Optics 48.35 (2009): 6670-6683.
 

Quick Start
=============
* Download the source code. 
* Open main.m in MATLAB. 
* Choose the desired index of refraction for your tissue. n = 1, 1.33 and 1.44 are available. 
* Run the code


For n = 1.44, the file ReflectanceN144.mat contain sample reflectance values. You can use this to see if the model will be accurate in your application
